The extension allows you to add data visualisations to your TYPO3 project. It
provides plugins to equip with data and use as content elements in the backend,
as well as ``ViewHelpers`` to use in your templates. VIS is compatible to the
Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF), which provides various data models on top
of this package.
