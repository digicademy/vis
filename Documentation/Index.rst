This extension aims to provide a range of data visualisations to be used in
TYPO3. This includes charts and word clouds, but also timelines, interactive
graphs, and maps. Visualisations are largely based on a small set of
external libraries, but may also be custom designs to keep the number of
external libraries included in the extension small. All visualisations aim
to be as accessible as possible, but also allow to be hidden from screen
readers in case they are illustrations of information already available to
users who rely on screen readers. VIS is compatible with, but not explicitly
a part of, the Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF), a research software suite
that helps you build web apps to produce and publish data in the humanities.
